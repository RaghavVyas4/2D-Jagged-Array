<h1>2D Jagged Array</h1>
<h3>In this you'll learn how to create a 2D jagged array in c++ using dynamic memory allocation</h3>

Before, let's learn what is a 2D jagged array.
These arrays are kind of similar to any 2D array but have 1 Big difference of size of their columns, meaning unlike normal 2D arrays, a Jagged array can have columns of different sizes.

Here's a visual representation of 2D Jagged Array:

 1 2 3 4<br>
 5 6<br>
 7 2 4<br>
 1 2 4 2 5 4<br>

 Here each row have different column sizes.

 The output of the code will look something like this: <br>
